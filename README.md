# HyQual Backend

A real REST API for the HyQual app: Node.js + Express + MySQL, JWT auth,
bcrypt password hashing, and SQL-driven reports (real AVG/MIN/MAX
aggregation over `water_quality_readings`, not fake numbers).

Tested end-to-end against a live MySQL instance before delivery — every
endpoint below was hit with real HTTP requests and verified to return
correct data (see the "What was actually tested" section).

## 1. Set up the database

You need MySQL or MariaDB running. Then:

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE hyquai_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
mysql -u root -p hyquai_db < database/schema.sql
mysql -u root -p hyquai_db < database/seed_data.sql
```

`database/schema.sql` is **your** ERD schema (from `ERD2.mwb`) with 6
corrections — each one is marked with a `-- CORRECTION:` comment in the
file explaining exactly what changed and why (short version: forecasts
and notifications needed a `pond_id` since your farms have multiple
ponds; notifications needed `is_read` separate from `is_resolved`;
devices needed a `device_key` for IoT auth; added a `password_resets`
table for the Forgot Password flow). Everything else is untouched.

`database/seed_data.sql` populates it with the same demo data the app
already shows: farm owner Juan Dela Cruz, 4 ponds (Normal/Warning/
Critical/Offline), 5 devices, ~7 days of realistic readings, and 5
notifications. Login with `farmer@hyquai.demo` / `HyQuai123!`.

Then create a database user for the app (or reuse root for local dev):

```sql
CREATE USER 'hyquai_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'choose_a_real_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hyquai_db.* TO 'hyquai_app'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 2. Configure and run the server

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD to what you created above,
# and set JWT_SECRET to a real random string:
#   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"

npm install
node server.js
```

You should see `HyQual API listening on port 4000`. Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

## 3. Point the Flutter app at it

Open `lib/data/api_client.dart` in the Flutter project and set `baseUrl`
to wherever this server is reachable from your phone/emulator — see the
comment block right above it for the Android-emulator-vs-physical-phone
gotchas (this is the #1 thing that trips people up: `localhost` from a
phone means the phone itself, not your computer).

## Regenerating demo data

`seed_generator.js` (in this folder) is the script that built
`seed_data.sql` — it writes realistic random-walk readings directly into
a running MySQL instance, then you'd `mysqldump` the result. Useful if
you want a fresh batch with today's timestamps:

```bash
node seed_generator.js
```

## API overview

- `POST /api/auth/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`
- `PUT /api/auth/change-password` (requires current password)
- `GET/PUT /api/profile`, `GET/PUT /api/farm`
- `GET/POST /api/ponds`, `PUT/DELETE /api/ponds/:id`, `GET /api/ponds/:id` (detail), `GET /api/ponds/:id/forecast`
- `GET/POST /api/devices`, `PUT/DELETE /api/devices/:id`, `GET /api/devices/:id`, `POST /api/devices/:id/assign`
- `POST /api/ingest/readings`, `POST /api/ingest/status` — called by the physical device (authenticated via `device_key`, not a user JWT). Posting a reading automatically creates or resolves alerts by comparing against `parameter_thresholds` — see `routes/ingest.js`.
- `GET /api/notifications` (+ `PUT .../read`, `PUT .../mark-all-read`)
- `GET /api/reports/trend`, `/reading-logs`, `/alert-logs`, `/summary`, `/list` — the real SQL aggregation endpoints

Every mutating/list endpoint except `/auth/*` and `/ingest/*` requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` from login/signup.

## What was actually tested

Every endpoint above was exercised with real HTTP requests against a
live MySQL database during development, including: signup, duplicate-
signup rejection, login, change password + re-login, forgot password,
full pond/device CRUD, device assignment, a simulated device posting a
threshold-breaching reading (confirmed it auto-created a CRITICAL
notification with the right message) followed by a normal reading
(confirmed the notification auto-resolved), and the reports summary
endpoint's AVG/MIN/MAX numbers were spot-checked against a manual SQL
query. A fresh database loaded from *only* `schema.sql` + `seed_data.sql`
was used for the final pass, so what you're getting is exactly what was
tested.

**Not tested:** the Flutter side calling this API. There's no Flutter
SDK in the environment this was built in, so the Dart code was written
carefully and cross-checked field-by-field against these exact API
response shapes, but not run. If something doesn't line up, it's most
likely a small field-name mismatch — paste the error back and it's a
quick fix.

## Known gaps (clearly marked with `TODO(db)` / `TODO(email)` in the code)

- CSV/XLSX report export and real PDF generation are stubbed (show a
  confirmation message but don't produce a real file yet)
- Forgot-password generates a real token but doesn't email it (needs a
  mail provider — logs the token to the server console for now)
- Forecast values are a simple heuristic based on the current reading,
  not a real prediction model
